- I'm Konner, a computer science student expecting to graduate in 2027! It's wonderful to meet you.
- I do lots of coding, from assignments to tests to personal projects to pass the time. I am incredibly interested in the world of technology, and am always willing to learn more!
- I am very fluent in C++, Java, and Python, and have minor experience in HTTP and several other languages.
- If you're interested, shoot me a message! I'd love to hear from you.
